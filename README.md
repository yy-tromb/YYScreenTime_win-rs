# YYScreenTime_win-rs
Windows ScreenTime App for me.  
***This app is replacement app of [YYScreenTime_win](https://github.com/yy-tromb/YYScreenTime_win) that written in C and Win32 APIs.*** I like Rust much more than C, so I have rewrited. Developping in C was very very painful.lol Whatever it is, I'm a beginner, though.  

## Now, I'm developping slowly, Please wait a lot.
